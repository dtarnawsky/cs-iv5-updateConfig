# Test App

Test app for Identity Vault

Click "Create, Clear, UpdateConfig"

When UpdateConfig is called on iOS it will update the configuration to biometrics and does not show a biometric prompt.

When UpdateConfig is called on Android it will show a biometric prompt even though the vault is not locked.
